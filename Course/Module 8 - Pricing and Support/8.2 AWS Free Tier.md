-> AWS Free Tier

The AWS Free Tier enables you to begin using certain services without having to worry about incurring costs for the specified period. 

Three types of offers are available: 

- Always Free
- 12 Months Free
- Trials

For each free tier offer, make sure to review the specific details about exactly which resource types are included. 

- Always Free:

    These offers do not expire and are available to all AWS customers.

    For example, AWS Lambda allows 1 million free requests and up to 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month. Amazon DynamoDB allows 25 GB of free storage per month.

- 12 Months Free:

    These offers are free for 12 months following your initial sign-up date to AWS.

    Examples include specific amounts of Amazon S3 Standard Storage, thresholds for monthly hours of Amazon EC2 compute time, and amounts of Amazon CloudFront data transfer out.

- Trials:

    Short-term free trial offers start from the date you activate a particular service. The length of each trial might vary by number of days or the amount of usage in the service.

    For example, Amazon Inspector offers a 90-day free trial. Amazon Lightsail (a service that enables you to run virtual private servers) offers 750 free hours of usage over a 30-day period.
