To learn more about the role of subnets within a VPC, review the following example from the coffee shop.

First, customers give their orders to the cashier. The cashier then passes the orders to the barista.
This process allows the line to keep running smoothly as more customers come in. 

Suppose that some customers try to skip the cashier line and give their orders directly to the barista. 
This disrupts the flow of traffic and results in customers accessing a part of the coffee shop 
that is restricted to them.

This is similar to how you can use AWS networking services to isolate resources and determine exactly how network traffic flows.

In the coffee shop, you can think of the counter area as a VPC. The counter area divides into two separate areas for the cashier’s workstation and the barista’s workstation. In a VPC, subnets are separate areas that are used to group together resources.


-> Subnets
A subnet is a section of a VPC in which you can group resources based on security or operational needs. 
Subnets can be public or private.

Public subnets contain resources that need to be accessible by the public, such as an online store’s website.

Private subnets contain resources that should be accessible only through your private network, such as a database that contains customers’ personal information and order histories. 

In a VPC, subnets can communicate with each other. For example, you might have an application that involves Amazon EC2 instances in a public subnet communicating with databases that are located in a private subnet.

-> Network traffic in a VPC
When a customer requests data from an application hosted in the AWS Cloud, this request is sent as a packet. A packet is a unit of data sent over the internet or a network. 

It enters into a VPC through an internet gateway. Before a packet can enter into a subnet or exit from a subnet, it checks for permissions. These permissions indicate who sent the packet and how the packet is trying to communicate with the resources in a subnet.

The VPC component that checks packet permissions for subnets is a network access control list (ACL).

-> Network access control lists (ACLs)
A network access control list (ACL) is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet level.

For example, step outside of the coffee shop and imagine that you are in an airport. In the airport, travelers are trying to enter into a different country. You can think of the travelers as packets and the passport control officer as a network ACL. The passport control officer checks travelers’ credentials when they are both entering and exiting out of the country. If a traveler is on an approved list, they are able to get through. However, if they are not on the approved list or are explicitly on a list of banned travelers, they cannot come in.

Each AWS account includes a default network ACL. When configuring your VPC, you can use your account’s default network ACL or create custom network ACLs. 

By default, your account’s default network ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic, but you can modify it by adding your own rules. For custom network ACLs, all inbound and outbound traffic is denied until you add rules to specify which traffic to allow. Additionally, all network ACLs have an explicit deny rule. This rule ensures that if a packet doesn’t match any of the other rules on the list, the packet is denied. 

-> Stateless packet filtering
Network ACLs perform stateless packet filtering. They remember nothing and check packets that cross the subnet border each way: inbound and outbound. 

Recall the previous example of a traveler who wants to enter into a different country. This is similar to sending a request out from an Amazon EC2 instance and to the internet.

When a packet response for that request comes back to the subnet, the network ACL does not remember your previous request. The network ACL checks the packet response against its list of rules to determine whether to allow or deny.

After a packet has entered a subnet, it must have its permissions evaluated for resources within the subnet, such as Amazon EC2 instances. 

The VPC component that checks packet permissions for an Amazon EC2 instance is a security group.

->Security groups

A security group is a virtual firewall that controls inbound and outbound traffic for an Amazon EC2 instance.

By default, a security group denies all inbound traffic and allows all outbound traffic. You can add custom rules to configure which traffic to allow or deny.

For this example, suppose that you are in an apartment building with a door attendant who greets guests in the lobby. You can think of the guests as packets and the door attendant as a security group. As guests arrive, the door attendant checks a list to ensure they can enter the building. However, the door attendant does not check the list again when guests are exiting the building

If you have multiple Amazon EC2 instances within a subnet, you can associate them with the same security group or use different security groups for each instance. 

-> Stateful packet filtering
Security groups perform stateful packet filtering. They remember previous decisions made for incoming packets.

Consider the same example of sending a request out from an Amazon EC2 instance to the internet. 

When a packet response for that request returns to the instance, the security group remembers your previous request. The security group allows the response to proceed, regardless of inbound security group rules.

Both network ACLs and security groups enable you to configure custom rules for the traffic in your VPC. As you continue to learn more about AWS security and networking, make sure to understand the differences between network ACLs and security groups.
