- Read the full question.

    First, make sure that you read each question in full. Key words or phrases in the question that, if left unread, could result in you selecting an incorrect response option.

- Predict the answer before reviewing the response options.

    Next, try to predict the correct answer before looking at any of the response options. 

    This strategy helps you to draw directly from your knowledge and skills without distraction from incorrect response options. If your prediction turns out to be one of the response options, this can be helpful for knowing whether youâ€™re on the right track. However, make sure that you review all the other response options for that question.

- Eliminate incorrect response options.

    Before selecting your response to a question, eliminate any options that you believe to be incorrect. 

    This strategy helps you to focus on the correct option (or options, for multiple-response questions) and ensure that you have fulfilled all the requirements of the question.
