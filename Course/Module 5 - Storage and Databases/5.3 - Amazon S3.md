->Object Storage
In object storage, each object consists of data, metadata, and a key.

The data might be an image, video, text document, or any other type of file.
Metadata contains information about what the data is, how it is used, the object size, and so on.
An objectâ€™s key is its unique identifier.

-> Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)
Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is a service that provides object-level storage.
Amazon S3 stores data as objects in buckets.

You can upload any type of file to Amazon S3, such as images, videos, text files, and so on.
For example, you might use Amazon S3 to store backup files, media files for a website, or archived documents.
Amazon S3 offers unlimited storage space. The maximum file size for an object in Amazon S3 is 5 TB.

When you upload a file to Amazon S3, you can set permissions to control visibility and access to it.
You can also use the Amazon S3 versioning feature to track changes to your objects over time.

->Amazon S3 storage classes
With Amazon S3, you pay only for what you use. You can choose from a range of storage classes to select a fit for your business and cost needs. When selecting an Amazon S3 storage class, consider these two factors:
